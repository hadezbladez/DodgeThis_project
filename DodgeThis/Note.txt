
dodge this note

this game is dodge left right and middle

there many level speed max 15 frame
1. standard mode
	open only 1 or 2 gaps (usually 2 with pattern)
2. special mode speed max 25 frame
	open 2 gap (longer) with ping-pong balls
	memory mode
	labyrinth

do we need assets?




about gameloop and some threading fix
there is so much things to fix here like this problem
1. 	there is something wrong why its like lag and box kinda stepping back a moment
	it steps back 8 pixel >> become 4 pixel because u zoom 2 time

heres the web
1. using nanosecond with times 60 will remove the floting point number (like we already did)
